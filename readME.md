**Audiophile Project**


I have developed a dynamic and responsive ecommerce website for audio products using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes product display, category-based filtering, and a shopping cart complete with essential features. Users can explore an enticing product catalog, seamlessly add items to their cart, and witness real-time price updates based on quantity.





To see the result, you can download the folder and use VS Code, and to emulate the local database, use json-server. 

**Install** it with this command: 

"**npm install -g json-server**" 

and run it with: 

"**json-server --watch data_base/db.json**", 

with terminal at folder level. 
Also use **live-server** to emulate the host.
