**Audiophile Project**


I have developed a dynamic ecommerce website for audio products using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes product display, category-based filtering, and a shopping cart with real-time price updates. Users can add, remove, and modify quantities of products in the cart. This project showcases my proficiency in frontend development and my ability to create an engaging and functional user experience.




To see the result, you can download the folder and use VS Code, and to emulate the local database, use json-server. Install it with this command: "npm install -g json-server" and run it with: "json-server --watch data_base/db.json", with terminal at folder level. 
Also use live-server to emulate the host.
