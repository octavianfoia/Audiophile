Command to run in terminal at folder level to emulate the db.json:

json-server --watch data_base/db.json



JSON-Server is a tool that allows you to quickly create a RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) based on a JSON file. It simulates a full-featured back-end server without the need for a real server. By running the command "json-server --watch data_base/db.json" in your terminal, you are starting the JSON-Server and telling it to watch the db.json file for any changes. This allows you to make HTTP requests to the server and retrieve or modify the data in the JSON file.




fetchProducts(): This function uses the Fetch API to send an HTTP GET request to the JSON-Server and retrieve the product data from the db.json file. It returns a Promise that resolves to the response data as JSON. Inside the function, the fetch() function is called with the URL of the JSON-Server endpoint, which is typically "http://localhost:3000/products". The fetch() function returns a Promise that resolves to the response object. The response is then checked to ensure it was successful (with response.ok), and if so, the JSON data is extracted and returned using response.json().

renderProduct(product): This function takes a single product object as a parameter and generates the HTML markup for displaying that product on the webpage. It returns the generated HTML as a string. The function uses template literals (denoted by backticks ```) to construct the HTML markup dynamically, using the properties of the product object.

displayProducts(products): This function takes an array of products as a parameter and iterates over each product. For each product, it calls the renderProduct() function to generate the HTML markup and appends it to the DOM (Document Object Model) within a specified element with the ID "product-list". This effectively displays the products on the webpage.

init(): This function serves as the entry point of the web app. It calls the fetchProducts() function to retrieve the product data, and then chains a .then() method to the Promise returned by fetchProducts(). Inside the .then() callback, it calls the displayProducts() function, passing in the retrieved product data. This ensures that the products are displayed on the webpage once they are fetched.

To summarize the flow of the code: When the web app is loaded, the init() function is called. It fetches the product data from the JSON-Server using fetchProducts(), and once the data is retrieved, it is displayed on the webpage using displayProducts().

I hope this explanation clarifies the code and the concepts involved! Let me know if you have any further questions.


/////////////////////////////////
JSON Data Retrieval and Rendering
The code includes a function called getItems(category, item_) that is responsible for fetching JSON data from a server and rendering it on the webpage. Let's break down this function and understand its purpose:

javascript
Copy code
function getItems(category, item_) {
  fetch("/data_base/db.json")
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      if (category) {
        renderCategory(data);
      }
      if (item_) {
        renderItem(data);
      }
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error("Error JSON:", error);
    });
}
The getItems function takes two parameters: category and item_. These parameters are used to determine which parts of the fetched data should be rendered.

The fetch function is used to make an HTTP request to the specified URL "/data_base/db.json" and retrieve the JSON data from the server.

The fetch function returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object. We can chain methods to this Promise using the .then() function.

The first .then() callback is executed when the Promise is resolved. It takes the response object as an argument and calls the .json() method on it. This converts the response data into a JavaScript object.

The second .then() callback is executed when the Promise from the previous .then() resolves. It takes the parsed JSON data as the data parameter. Inside this callback, there are conditional statements that check if category or item_ are truthy values.

If category is truthy (i.e., it has a value), the renderCategory function is called with the data object as an argument. The implementation of the renderCategory function is not provided in the code snippet you shared, so we can't analyze it further.

If item_ is truthy (i.e., it has a value), the renderItem function is called with the data object as an argument. Similarly, the implementation of the renderItem function is not included in the code snippet.
